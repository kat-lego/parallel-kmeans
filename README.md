# parallel_kmeans
In recent years, data has played a large role in technological advancements. We have seen high-volumes in data being collected over recent years. Much of the data being collected is high-dimensional, consisting of thousands of dimensions and someone has to make sense of it all. Cluster analysis has been a tool used to find natural groupings for a set of instances in a dataset. K-means is a simple clustering technique to achieve this and happens to be computationally intensive. This project implements parallel versions of k means using MPI and CUDA. You can find more details on the subject and the implementation on the writeup.

## Results.
